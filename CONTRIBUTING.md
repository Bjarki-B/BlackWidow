Commits should be structured as:
--------------------------------
<KEYWORD> [Short Description]
[Body (if required) with more information]

[Footer (if required) explaining the issues fixed by the commit]
--------------------------------

The KEYWORD should be one of the following
fix, feat, docs, style, test, setup

fix   - for fixes to the code including bugfixes or efficiency improvements
feat  - when a new feature is added
docs  - for changes to documentation
style - for style changes
test  - for any tests uploaded
setup - when new pieces are added to the repo such as new directories or empty files

The short description should be under 100 characters (including keyword) to describe what is in the commit

The body should contain more information on what is included in the commit, not always required

The footer should contain information on the issues the commit addresses, not always required
